                <h3>SpaceX Crew-9 astronauts fly Dragon spacecraft to new ISS parking spot</h3>
                <p>Four astronauts moved their SpaceX Dragon spacecraft to a new space station docking port on
                    Sunday(Nov. 3) to make way for an incoming cargo ship.The SpaceX Crew-9 astronauts, including two
                    crew members formerly aboard Boeing's Starliner spacecraft, moved their Crew Dragon capsule Freedom
                    to an unused parking spot on top of the
                    International Space Station ahead of the planned Nov. 4 launch of an uncrewed Dragon resupply ship
                    by the company.SpaceX is scheduled to launch that cargo variant of Dragon from NASA's Kennedy Space
                    Statin in
                    Florida on Monday at 9:29 p.m. EST (0229 GMT) carrying more than 3 tons of supplies for the ISS
                    crew. It should arrive Tuesday morning (Nov. 5) if all goes well.</p>

                <h3>China's Shenzhou 18 astronauts return to Earth today after 6 months in space</h3>
                <p>China's Shenzhou 18 crew are ready to return home after more than six months in space.Astronauts Ye
                    Guangfu, Li Cong and Li Guangsu have been living aboard the Tiangong space station
                    since April 25 this year, but are set to return to Earth on Sunday (Nov. 3) after completing their
                    mission.The trio greeted the incoming Shenzhou 19 crew aboard Tiangong on Oct. 30, meaning China
                    briefly has
                    six astronauts in space. Commander Ye officially handed over the control of the orbital outpost to
                    Shenzhou 19 commander Cai Xuzhe on Nov. 1. The official ceremony marked China's fifth such orbital
                    changeover since completing the three-module space station in late 2022.</p>

                <h3>Space isn’t all about the 'race' – arrival superpowers must work together for a better future</h3>
                <p>In recent years, a new “space race” has intensified between the United States and China. At a
                    campaign rally last weekend, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump invoked this rivalry
                    when declaring the US will "lead the world in space," echoing Democratic counterpart Vice President
                    Kamala Harris.Geopolitical tensions are again moving off-Earth. The US and China are leading
                    separate missions which aim to return humans to the Moon. One goal is to further scientific
                    research. But space mining and economic expansionism are also driving these efforts.This new "race"
                    may give rise to new conflicts, especially over prime landing sites and valuable and
                    scarce resources speculated to be located on the lunar south pole.</p>

                <h3>NASA’s Webb Confirms Its First Exoplanet!</h3>
                <p>Researchers confirmed an exoplanet, a planet that orbits another star, using NASA’s James Webb Space
                    Telescope for the first time. Formally classified as LHS 475 b, the planet is almost exactly the
                    same size as our own, clocking in at 99% of Earth’s diameter. The research team is led by Kevin
                    Stevenson and Jacob Lustig-Yaeger, both of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory
                    in Laurel, Maryland.</p>

                <h3>An Unexpected Object Is Blasting Powerful Radiation in Deep Space</h3>
                <p>
                    V4641 Sagittarii is a system about 20,000 light-years from Earth, in the direction of the
                    constellation Sagittarius. There, a black hole with the mass of about six Suns is slurping material
                    off a giant star of about three solar masses – and producing intense radiation like a cosmic
                    particle accelerator</p>

                <h3>Breakthrough in Black Hole Research</h3>
                <p>Researchers at Tohoku University and Utsunomiya University have made a breakthrough in understanding
                    the complex nature of turbulence in structures called “accretion disks” surrounding black holes,
                    using state-of-the-art supercomputers to conduct the highest-resolution simulations to date. An
                    accretion disk, as the name implies, is a disk-shaped gas that spirals inwards towards a central
                    black hole.</p>

                    The new Tiangong team will carry out experiments with an eye to the space programme's ambitious goal
                    of placing astronauts on the Moon by 2030 and eventually constructing a lunar base.

                    The Shenzhou-19 mission took off with its trio of space explorers at 4:27 am (2027 GMT Tuesday) from

                <p>Description: An astronaut crew's rocket made its last major journey on Earth before blasting off for
                    the moon.

                    The core stage of Artemis 2's rocket came to NASA's Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in Florida on Tuesday
                    (July 23). The rocket stage was offloaded from NASA's Pegasus barge, which shipped the rocket stage
                    900 miles (1,450 km) by water from NASA's Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans, in a seven-hour
                    operation aided by remote controlled vehicles known as self-propelled modular transporters.

                    The 212-foot (65-meter) stage then made the half-mile (0.8 km) journey to NASA's Vehicle Assembly
                    Building where it will eventually be joined to the rest of the Space Launch System rocket for a
                    launch no earlier than September 2025..</p>
